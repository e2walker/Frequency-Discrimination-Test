Frequency Discrimination Threshold Project for Psych 14P: Scientific Python for Research

Collaboration between Enya Walker and Kristie Flores, completed under Dr. Ramesh Srinivasan

This project consists of two files. The first, "FrequencyDiscriminationThreshold_Experiment," runs a simple adaptive test of a subject's ability to discriminate between tones starting at 440, 880, or 1760 Hz. Instructions to run this test are included in the file. After completion of the test, a .csv file tiled "Experiment_SubjectN," where N represents the subject ID, will be generated for the purpose of analysis.

The second file, "FrequencyDiscriminationThreshold_Analysis," graphs the results of the experiment's .csv outputs. This file is set up to evaluate two subjects, generating a line graph recording each subject's performance and a joint bar graph comparing each subject's discrimination threshold at 440, 880, and 1760 Hz.
